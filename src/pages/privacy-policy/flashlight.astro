      <p>Ottler Studio ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Ottler Flashlight ("the app") handles your information.</p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We <strong>do not collect</strong> any personal information or usage data from users of Ottler Flashlight.<br />
      The app operates entirely on your device and does not transmit or store any user data on our servers.</p>

      <p>Examples of data we do <strong>not</strong> collect include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name, email address, or other contact information</li>
        <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or crash logs</li>
        <li>Location data or any content displayed on your screen</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>Since we do not collect any information, we do not use your data for any purpose such as analytics, advertising, or personalization.</p>

      <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
      <p>Because we do not collect any data, we do not share any data with third parties.<br />
      The app does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking services.</p>

      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>We do not store any user data on our servers or in external systems.<br />
      All functionality is performed locally on your device, so there is no user data for us to secure.</p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Ottler Flashlight does not collect any personal information from users, including children under the age of 13.<br />
      If this changes in the future, we will update this policy and, where required, obtain appropriate consent.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.<br />
      If we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
